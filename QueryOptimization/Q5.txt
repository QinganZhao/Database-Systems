For Sailors, we have 8000 / (20 + 4 + 4) = 285 tuples per page, and 100000 / 285 = 351 pages; For Reserves, we have 200000 / (8000 / (4 + 4 + 8)) = 400 pages; For Boats, we have 8000 / (20 + 4) = 333 tuples per page, and 10000 / 333 = 31 pages. For \sigma_{rating>5}, the scanning process costs 351 I/Os, writing to disk cost 351 / 2 = 176 I/Os. For the first BNL join, the cost is 176 + 176 / (20 - 2) * 400 = 4176 I/Os. For \pi_{Bid}, since we only need bid and not eliminating duplicates, the cost will be 4 * 100000 / 8000 = 50 I/Os. For the second Sort-Merge-Join, since 25 / 20 + 30 / 20 < 20 - 1, we use the refined version and the cost will be 3 * (50 + 31) = 243 I/Os. Hence the total cost will be 351 + 176 + 4176 + 50 + 243 = 4996.
