We need to hash both the smaller and the larger relation, and the partition of the smaller relation’s hash table would be put into main memory. The smaller relation in this case is R which has 100 pages. The main memory should be able to able to hold all the partitions of R in the partition phase when each partition has 1 page output and the largest partition in the join phase, which means (12 – 1) * (12 – 2) = 110 pages should be larger than the relation if we want to hash join with a single partitioning pass. As 110 > 100 pages in R, the hash join between R and S could be done with 12 buffer pages in main memory.
