For relation R, there are 80 * 10000 / 8000 = 100 pages, and we need 2 passes to sort them. As the first pass we could sort 12 pages, and second pass 12 * 11 = 132 > 100 pages could be sorted. And the sorting takes 100 * 2 * 2 = 400 I/Os. For relation S, there are 100*50000/8000 = 625 pages, and we need 3 passes to sort them (the third pass 12 * 11 * 11 = 1452 > 625 pages could be sorted). So the sorting for S takes 625 * 3 * 2 = 3750 I/Os. The cost to scan all pages and merge them would be close to 625 + 100 = 725 I/Os. So in total 400 + 3750 + 725 = 4875 I/Os are needed.
